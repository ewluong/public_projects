### Abstract

In the present era of globalization and interconnectivity, diversity has become a prominent focal point, especially within the corporate realm. Some studies explored the link between diversity and a company's performance, utilizing organizational-level statistics; others turned their focus on leadership-level statistics (see References). In our study, we explored the correlation between leadership level diversity and its impact on the stock market performance of corporations.
The main objective of this study is to uncover what diversity and centrality metrics within a firm’s leadership have significant correlations to firm performance, and if it's possible to outperform a baseline market return with an understanding of those metrics. In this study, diversity refers to the variances in ethnicity, gender, and age within a firm’s leadership, and centrality refers to the relative importance of a leader within a firm, based on their network relationships and influence within the organization.
Guided by the Quant Equity Group (QEG) of Vanguard, which oversees about $50 billion in active systematic strategies primarily invested in public equities, our team conducted data collection to identify and gather relevant datasets on executive directors, financial performance metrics, and market performance. Using metrics such as the Herfindahl–Hirschman index for diversity, age range standard deviation, and centrality measurements, we generated a dataset to represent a firm’s leadership diversity, centrality, and then paired with its performance on the stock market over a period of 15 years.
Our analysis suggests that certain leadership diversity and centrality measures did have statistically significant correlations with the forward returns of firms. However, due to the scope of the project and time constraints, these results merit further studies on the multifaceted phenomena of diversity vs performance.
