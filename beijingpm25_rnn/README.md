### Abstract  

This project employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict next-day PM2.5 pollution levels in Beijing. Utilizing an hourly dataset from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, the project follows a complete data science workflow. The dataset is initially loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and aggregated at a daily level. Various meteorological features are used alongside pollution levels from previous days to train the RNN model. The project also includes data visualization to help interpret the raw data and the model's performance. It serves as a comprehensive example of using RNNs for time-series forecasting in environmental science.
